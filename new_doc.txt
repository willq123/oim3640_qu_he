This is the plan:

we are making a book reommendaiton review site

steps for viewer

1. they go on to the website and create a username or relogin with the same username
2. the website will ask what books (up to 5) you read recently and what is thier rating out of 10 for the book
3. next it will give out 15 books that have a similar themes and ask them if they have read these books 
    3.1 if yes then they will ask your rating out of 10 for these books
    3.2 we will keep giving them similar book until they have recognized 10 of book
4. with this information they will give out 5 books recommendation (that they have not read) and their summary that could found online/chatgpt
5. we can then store what they have read as all as thier ratings out of 10 onto a database so they can have acess and share if they want
6. if oyu know thier username you can also see how similar you are with other readers
7. if oyu relogin with the same user name you can indicate books you read in that time and your rating of it and it give you more recommendations
